# Palindrome

1. Write a function (incl. tests) that asks the user for a string and tells them whether or not it is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "ABBA" and "AOXOMOXOA" are palindromes. "CHOCOLATE" and "DOODLE" are not.
(If there is a function built into your language that reverses a list or a string, you may not use it in your solution.)

What tests should I write ? Those necessary to test if the function works, as you would recommend for a production development

What language should I use ? .netcore or Angular 9/10 (what you are most familiar with)

2. Add a debug-output in which you log all relevant information that could be helpful to you for debugging the function (time/date, variables etc.)

(If you have a build in debug/log generator you may not use it)
